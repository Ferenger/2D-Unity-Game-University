# 2D Unity Game

One of the first games I was ever really happy with and felt like an actual 'game game' by my personal standards so this game has a special place for me. Really fond of this one. It's a small 2D RPG game and was made for 1st Year University Game Dev Coursework.

This features me mostly just exploring 2D Unity and coding in Unity
